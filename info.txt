<h3>What is County?</h3>

County is your countdown section for PageLines. 

County can countdown to any date and any time into the future. 

Do you need a beautiful landing page while you are developing your site and want to let your customers know when you are up and running? Well County can do that for you. 

You can even tell your friends on your personal blog that your birthday is coming up. 

Oh... did I tell County is cloneable? You can have as many countdowns as you want anywhere on your PageLines site.
